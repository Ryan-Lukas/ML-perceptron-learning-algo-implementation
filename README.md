Background
------------

This was an implementation of the perceptron learning algorithm for my CS 5350 Machine learning class. We took part of a Kaggle competition that decided if someone was going to be guilty or not within the Old Bailey criminal trail. The added libsvm files are added that we used to determine the outcome of these trials.
